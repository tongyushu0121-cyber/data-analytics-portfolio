# Project: Sales Forecasting (Python)

**Goal**: Build a time-series model (ARIMA/Prophet) to forecast monthly demand.

## Steps
1. Prepare a monthly time series `date, sales` (24â€“60 months recommended).  
2. Try ARIMA (statsmodels) and Prophet (fbprophet / prophet).  
3. Compare RMSE/MAE via time-based split.  
4. Plot forecast vs actual and discuss implications for staffing/inventory.

## Deliverables
- Notebook with model comparison
- Forecast plot PNG
- Brief README
